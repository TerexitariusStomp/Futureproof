# Problems

## Speculative Value

NFTs currently only have a speculative value (i.e. the NFT is only worth as much as a person thinks the art or other material represented is worth). There's not an established floor value at which a person can always trade their NFT for.&#x20;

## Decline in NFT Value

In most NFT marketplaces an NFT is only able to be traded when another person wants it. If no one wants that NFT then it is held until a time in the future when someone does, collapsing in price over time with little to no demand.&#x20;

## Wash Trading for Tokens

NFT marketplaces that distribute tokens for buying and selling of NFTs have been able to take a large percentage of Openseaâ€™s [Marketshare](https://dune.com/sealaunch/NFT) ([X2Y2](https://github.com/X2Y2-io), and [Looksrare](https://github.com/LooksRare/looksrare-sdk); both on Github). However, wash trading of NFTs to get tokens has become a problem in these marketplaces.&#x20;
