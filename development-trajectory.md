# Development Trajectory

## NFT Wallets

A key component of our NFT marketplace is to enable NFTs to hold tokens. There's 2 ways this can be done- either through an ERC6551 implementation or Charged Particles.&#x20;

ERC 6551

A larger and more active development community, as well as an accepted token standard.&#x20;

Charged Particles

An organization that started before ERC 6551 and may have some useful code to improve ERC 6551 with.&#x20;
