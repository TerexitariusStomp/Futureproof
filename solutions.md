NFTs need to be able to increase and or maintain their value over time.

## Futureproof NFTs

When rewarding people for interacting on the marketplace instead of the tokens being sent directly to wallets, the tokens are embedded in the NFTs themselves. These tokens are time locked so that after a set amount of time the tokens embedded can be taken and traded. During the time that the tokens are embedded in the NFT, the NFT has value not only for the art of the NFT but also for the tokens locked inside.
